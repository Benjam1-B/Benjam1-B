Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I'm Benjamin Brunet, a self-taught developer with a passion for the world of programming. I've built my background using free online platforms, which has given me a solid foundation of skills.

👨‍💻 My main skills include ABAP, JavaScript and SQL. I am currently training in front-end development, specifically via SAPUI5, with the aim of becoming a front-end developer on the SAP platform.

🌟 Although I don't have any notable open source projects under my belt yet, I am determined to contribute more to the development community and create innovative projects in the future.

📚 I'm also preparing for a FIORI certification, to validate my skills in the SAP user interface field.

Outside of development, I'm a keen footballer and love spending time with my family. What's more, I can't deny my passion for cooking, as there's nothing better than enjoying delicious home-cooked meals.

Please feel free to explore my projects and contact me if you have any questions, ideas for collaboration or simply to discuss anything related to the world of programming. Together we can achieve great things! 🚀
